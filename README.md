# Jay Fallon Portfolio - Edition of October 2016

## The short version

#### 1. Fire up your terminal
#### 2. Clone this repo via `git clone https://github.com/jayfallon/jayfallon-portfolio.git`
#### 3. From the repo's root directory type `npm install`
#### 4. Once all modules are intstalled, type `gulp`

This will start a web server and open up the application in a new browser window which will be refreshed using BrowserSync. You really don't have to do anything.

All edits should be made in the `/src` directory and will be automatically updated to the `/dist` directory from where they are served to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
