        <strong>I design and build mobile, responsive and desktop applications.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Specializing in designing user-centric experiences, simplified navigation concepts and componetized layouts, my preffered methodology is to rapidly prototype for mobile, desktop or responsive applications, enabling the team to gather enough testing
        data to prove out the hypothesis and reiterate where neccesary, all the while perfecting the design and content to achieve greater margins of success.</p>

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <p>The Javascript stack is where I maily find myself working mostly these days, whether it be rapidly iterating through fully-functional prototypes or building out and testing large-scale front-end applications, whether it be using React, Angular or
        Polymer. My preferred approach is using automated build tools like Gulp in conjuction with Postcss for many applications, like this
        <a href="https://github.com/jayfallon/jayfallon-portfolio">website</a>, and while agnostic in regards to CSS variants and frameworks, I can easily implement solutions using Bootstrap, Foundation or other frameworks, including home-grown solutions.</p>

      <p>In the past I have worked as a consultant with firms in the educational, financial and pharmaceutical industries such as Cengage Learning, Fidelity Management &amp; Resource Company, State Street Global Advisors, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pfizer and
        ADQSR. Outside of large firms, I have also worked with startup ventures like Rapid7, MallNetworks, Wis.dm and Gobi.com.</p>
